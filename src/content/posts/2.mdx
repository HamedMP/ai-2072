# The Ethics of Computing

As AI systems become more powerful, an ancient question takes on new urgency: "How do we make sure that a machine does what we want, and only what we want?"

Like the Greek myth of King Midas, whose wish to turn everything he touched into gold backfired tragically, our relationship with AI brings both promise and peril. The golden age of generative AI has accelerated these concerns beyond academic circles into urgent public discourse.

## Beyond Right and Wrong

Modern AI ethics isn't simply about programming machines to follow rules. It requires deep examination of competing values like fairness, transparency, and utility. For example, when COMPAS (an AI system for predicting criminal recidivism) produced racially disparate outcomes, the key question wasn't just whether the system was "biased" but which specific conception of fairness should apply.

## Interdisciplinary Approaches

The most promising solutions come from combining technical and philosophical expertise. As MIT's new course on Computing Ethics demonstrates, effective AI governance requires both rigorous technical understanding and philosophical frameworks to navigate complex value tradeoffs.
